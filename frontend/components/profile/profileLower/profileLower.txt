this component will contain the subcomponents that will be rendered in the lower
half of the profile component:
1. Feed
2. LikedPosts
3. Following
4. Followers

Follows/Followings will be fetched as a batch

requestFollowsFollowings(userId)
  .then((data) => dispatch(receiveFollows(data)))

data :{
  userId: (the userId whose information was requested for),
  users: {
    will contain the users as objects
  },
  followedUsers: [],
  followingUsers: []
}

the followsReducer must intercept the action to grab either the followedUsers or 
followingUsers arrays and cache them under the id of the user

the usersReducer must intercept the action to grab the users from the users object
and place them within the users slice of state to cache them
